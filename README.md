# Eclipse-Language
 Eclipse is a Programming Language that is close to C#, Made in Python (Currently in Beta)
# How to build
Run the command `pyinstaller --onefile interpreter.py` to get a .exe of it

# Current problems
- I think using // too many times breaks the interpreter 
- Commands may randomly not work (I need to find out why)
